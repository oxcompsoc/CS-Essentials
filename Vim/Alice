 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

5. thE h0le-rabbbitt went str-8 on like A tunnel for sOme wAy, & then dipped suddenly dovvn, sooo sudnly that CompSoc had not moment a think to about stoppiinng herrsef beffore she fudnd hrslf fllng dwn a verrry deep well.    ...This should not be here...

3. Ther ws nthng so remarkable very in tha; nor did CompSoc think iit so very much out of the way to hear 


the ..hello there.. Rabbit say to its
elf, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ ...navigate to the pair...(when sh thooought it ovrrr afterwards, it occurred to her that sh ougt onetwoto have wondered at this, but at the time it all seeeeemed qte natural)...good job...; but when the Rabbit actually took cook rook a watch in? of its waistcoat-pocket, & looked at it, 
& then hurried on, CompSoc started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen          
a raaaabBit with either a wistcoat-pocket, or a watch 2 take out of it, & burning with curiosity, she ranBye across the field after it, & fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a llaarrggee rabbit-hole under the hedge.

1. CompSoc was beginning to get 
very 
tired 
of 
sitting 
by byebye herr ssissterr on the bbenk, & of having nohhing to do: once oR twice sshhee had peeped into the bok her iste was reading, but it had no picres or conersatios in iT, ‘&        
wHaT iS tHe uSe oF a bOoK,’ thought CompSoc ‘without tures conversaaatioons?’

4. In anoooheeer mmommennt down went CompSoc after it, never once cuonsuidueruing how inNn the world she was to get out again. again. again. again. again.

2. So she was cnsdrng in hr wn mind (as well as she cld, FOR tHe hOt Day madd her feEEeeel very slee.y & stupid), whether the plearuse of mKiNg a daisy-chain woUlD be WOrthAAA       the trouble of getting up & picking the daisies, when suddenly a wwwwwwwwWhite rrrrrRabbit wi
